# Inventory Management System â€“ Microservices with Spring Boot & Spring Cloud  


## Overview
The Inventory Management System is a distributed microservices-based application developed using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. It is designed to simulate a real-world inventory/e-commerce platform, enabling seamless management of users, products, inventory, carts, and payments with high scalability and modularity.

This system follows modern enterprise architecture patterns, ensuring each microservice is independently deployable, has its own database, and communicates with others securely via API Gateway and Eureka Service Discovery.


## Key capabilities include:
- Service discovery using **Eureka Server**  
- API routing and centralized access via **Spring Cloud Gateway**  
- Authentication and authorization with **Spring Security + JWT**  
- Independent services for **User, Product, Inventory, Cart, and Payment**  
- Inter-service communication with **OpenFeign**  
- Independent persistence layer per service (**MySQL/H2**)

## Service Breakdown

| Service            | Port  | Responsibility                        |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| Eureka Server       | 8761  | Service registry and discovery       |
| API Gateway         | 8080  | Routing, centralized access, JWT validation |
| User Service        | 8085  | Authentication, user management      |
| Product Service     | 8084  | Product catalog management           |
| Inventory Service   | 8083  | Inventory and stock management       |
| Cart Service        | 8082  | Shopping cart management             |
| Payment Service     | 8086  | Payment processing                   |

## Security Workflow
1. A client authenticates via the **User Service**.  
2. On successful login, the User Service issues a **JWT token**.  
3. The client attaches the token to subsequent requests in the **Authorization header**.  
4. The **API Gateway** validates the token before forwarding the request to downstream services.  
5. Domain services trust only requests that pass through the gateway with a valid token.
